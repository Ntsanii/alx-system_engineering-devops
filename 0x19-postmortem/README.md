## Issue Summary

**Duration:** 1 hour and 30 minutes (14:00 - 15:30 Central Africa Time)
**Impact:** A significant performance degradation of the e-commerce platform was experienced. Users reported slow loading times, difficulty adding items to cart, and unsuccessful checkout attempts. Approximately 70% of users were affected.
**Root Cause:** A surge in traffic combined with inefficient database query optimization led to database overload.

## Timeline

* **14:00 CAT:** Monitoring system alerts of increased database load and slow query response times.
* **14:15 CAT:** Initial investigation focused on application code for potential bottlenecks.
* **14:30 CAT:** Escalated to database administrator after ruling out application issues.
* **14:45 CAT:** Identified slow-performing database queries as the primary culprit.
* **15:15 CAT:** Implemented temporary database query optimizations.
* **15:30 CAT:** System performance restored to normal levels.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The underlying issue was a combination of unexpected high traffic and poorly optimized database queries. The surge in traffic overwhelmed the database, causing query response times to skyrocket. This resulted in cascading failures as the application struggled to process requests.

To resolve the issue, we implemented several database query optimizations. These included adding indexes to frequently queried columns, rewriting complex queries, and adjusting database connection pooling parameters. Additionally, we temporarily limited the number of concurrent database connections to prevent further overload.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent recurrence and improve overall system resilience, the following actions will be taken:

* **Database optimization:** Conduct a comprehensive review of all database queries to identify and optimize low-performing ones. Implement automated query performance monitoring.
* **Capacity planning:** Enhance capacity planning to accurately predict traffic spikes and adjust resource allocation accordingly.
* **Load testing:** Regularly conduct load tests to identify system bottlenecks and performance limitations.
* **Database caching:** Explore the use of database caching to reduce database load and improve response times.
* **Incident response:** Improve incident response procedures, including clearer communication channels and more detailed documentation.

### Specific Tasks

* Create a script to analyze query performance and identify optimization opportunities.
* Implement missing indexes based on query analysis.
* Rewrite complex queries to improve efficiency.
* Adjust database connection pool parameters for optimal performance.
* Develop a load testing framework to simulate different traffic scenarios.
* Implement monitoring for database load and query performance.
* Create a detailed incident response playbook.

By addressing these areas, we aim to significantly enhance the system's ability to handle increased traffic and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
